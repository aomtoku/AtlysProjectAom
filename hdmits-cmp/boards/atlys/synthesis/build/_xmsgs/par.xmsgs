<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="251" delta="new" >Map -timing was run with a lower effort level setting than you are using for PAR.  Xilinx recommends that you rerun Map -timing with the effort level that you have set in PAR to achieve better design performance.

<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3159" delta="new" >The DCM, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">PCLK_GEN_INST</arg>, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.
