WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, PCLK_GEN_INST, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists
   between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using
   FROM/TO constraints.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
