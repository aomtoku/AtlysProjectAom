  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

   removed.
WARNING:MapLib:39 - The timing specification "PERIOD=10000 pS HIGH 50%" on net
   "clk100" has been discarded, because the net was optimized out of the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net _n0057 is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  13 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   9 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "clk100_buf" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "clk100_IBUFG" is loadless and has been removed.

Section 10 - Timing Report

using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.
