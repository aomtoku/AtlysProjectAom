WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, PCLK_GEN_INST, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists
   between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using
   FROM/TO constraints.

WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <SYS_CLK> is placed at site <L15>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <sysclk_bufg> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y5>. There is only a
   select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and they
   are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and
   correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <SYS_CLK.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
