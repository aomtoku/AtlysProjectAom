WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal clk100 connected to top level port clk100 has been
   removed.
WARNING:MapLib:39 - The timing specification "PERIOD=10000 pS HIGH 50%" on net
   "clk100" has been discarded, because the net was optimized out of the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
