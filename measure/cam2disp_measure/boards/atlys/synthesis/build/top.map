      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   108 out of   6,822    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        68 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          267
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            61 out of     267   22%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              59 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
